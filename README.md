# Simple Bidding Website
## Overview
The baseline for this project was constructed in CS 336: Principles of Information and Data Management as a final project.  With the collaborative assistance of two partners @SelinaMLi and @yehbrian, we developed a functional JS website with SQL backend, emulating bidding websites (e.g. eBay).  Utilizing free-tier AWS and Apache Tomcat, the website not only features a platform for posting products and bidding but also a messaging and forum service, and administrative and company representative features to monitor critical statistics for the website, and to properly service the user base, respectively.

The website was posted for a time after the project's completion but has since been taken down.  Due to the private setting on the original project, I have transferred it over to this account for polishing/refining and posting.

## Usage and Details
URL to be posted shortly.

## ChangeLog
* Feb. 5, 2019 - ported the project over from [the original](https://github.com/SelinaMLi/CS336FinalProj).

## Roadmap
* Refactoring code for easier readability/maintenance.
* Improved UI (aesthetic only).
* Additional features (currently pending).

## Credits
I would like to thank @SelinaMLi and @yehbrian for their contributions to this project; without them, we would not have developed as far as the baseline for this project.  I would also like to thank Professor Alex Borgida for developing the framework for the course in which this project was initially developed.
